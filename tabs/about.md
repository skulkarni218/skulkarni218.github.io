				<p>I recently graduated with a master’s degree in Information Management from Syracuse University where I have gained technical skills in the field of Data and Business Analytics. 
				Apart from Analytics, I also focused a part of my curriculum on Project Management and I am a PMI certified associate project manager. 
				Currently, I am working as a Business Data Analyst and Business Intelligence Analyst with two different clients at iConsult Collaborative at Syracuse University where I am developing analytical solutions to drive and influence business decisions. 
				Before enrolling for my master’s degree, I have spent 3 years with Infosys Limited where I have worked with clients to understand their pain points, design and deploy innovative solutions to streamline business processes. 
				I am a person who finds happiness by making a difference in someone’s life and thrives in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. 
				With over 4 years of experience in various projects involving the use of management skills and analytics, I have gained strong awareness and understanding of successfully leading teams to develop innovative analytical solutions. 
				This is one of my greatest passions and hence I am seeking full-time opportunities in the fields of Data Analytics, Business Intelligence and Project Management. 
				If you are a recruiter, student or anyone interested in the aforementioned areas, feel free to reach out.
				<br><br>
				Apart from this, I am an enthusiastic photographer and football (soccer) is a major part of my life and I am a huge Manchester United FC fan.
