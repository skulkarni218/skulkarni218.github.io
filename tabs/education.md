> <br> <br> My name is Sudhanshu Kulkarni and I am currently pursuing my Masters in Information Management at Syracuse University. I am broadening my skillset in various areas of Data Analytics. I am seeking full-time opportunities in the fields of Data Analytics and Project Management. If you are a recruiter, student or anyone interested in the aforementioned areas, feel free to reach out.
<br> <br>Apart from academics, I am an enthusiastic photographer. Football (soccer) is a major part of my life and I am a huge Manchester United FC fan.
